# AMS_2021

The `AMS_OTA_Dashboard` notebook contains the code used to create the interactive dashboard hosted through the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Atmospheric Science website [OTA Dashboard Example](https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/~mgrover4/OT_map.html)

The example is from 10 August 2020, the day of the Midwest Derecho which led to several billions of dollars in damage.
